# Color-Bind
This game was made using Unity Open-GL in 2D. 

As a game, it utilizes color matching to create a mechanic that could be further developed.
It is considered unfinished due to University time constraints, but I hope to get back to this eventually.

There is a basic menu, UI, audio, tower placements, and mechanics already in place. 

If you would like to work on this project with me, let me know!
